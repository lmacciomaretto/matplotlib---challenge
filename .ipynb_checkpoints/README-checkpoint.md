# matplotlib---challenge

This is the repository of Assignment #5 - matplotlib challenge.

It contains a folder named Pymaceuticals_Inc, which holds the Jupyter Notebook with the script and data analysis and a subfolder named "data", with the 2 csv files needed for the analysis.

In this analysis we used statistical measures like mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM. We determined boundaries to find outliers in our data.

Plots in this script: Bar plots, Pie plots, Scatter plots and Line plots.
